    <h1>Apple Pie</h1>

    <img src="../images/apple-pie.jpg" alt="Apple Pie">

    <p>An apple pie is a classic American dessert that consists of a sweet, spiced apple filling baked inside a pastry crust. The filling is made by slicing apples and tossing them with sugar, cinnamon, and other spices like nutmeg or allspice.</p>

    <p>The crust is usually made from a mixture of flour, butter, and water, rolled out into a thin sheet and fitted into a pie dish. Once the filling is added, a second layer of pastry is placed on top and the edges are crimped together to seal the pie.</p>

    <p>Apple pies are typically baked until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. The finished pie is often served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, although it can also be enjoyed cold or at room temperature.</p>
    
    <p>There are many variations of apple pie, including deep-dish pies, lattice-top pies, and crumb-topped pies. Some bakers also like to add ingredients like caramel, raisins, or walnuts to their filling for extra flavor and texture.</p>

    <p>Apple pie is a popular dessert during the fall and winter months, especially around holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is a comforting and nostalgic treat that has been enjoyed by generations of Americans.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 pie crusts (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>6 cups thinly sliced and peeled apples (about 6 medium-sized apples)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Roll out one of the pie crusts and place it into a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well until the apples are coated evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour the apple mixture into the prepared crust, and dot the top with small pieces of butter.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second pie crust and use a sharp knife or pastry cutter to cut it into strips. Arrange the strips in a lattice pattern on top of the pie, weaving them together if desired.</li>
        <li>Trim off any excess crust, and crimp the edges of the pie to seal it. Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note: You can also make a crumb topping for your apple pie by combining 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup unsalted butter (cut into small pieces), and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle the crumb mixture over the apple filling before baking, and proceed with the rest of the recipe as written.</p>
